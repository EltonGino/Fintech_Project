Overview

This project provides a real-time stock data dashboard that allows users to analyze, forecast, and visualize stock prices. The dashboard integrates machine learning and deep learning models to generate short-term predictions of stock prices, offering insights through interactive charts and forecasting tools.

Features

	‚Ä¢	Data Fetching: Retrieve real-time stock data for a wide range of tickers.
	‚Ä¢	Custom Stock Selection: Users can choose popular stocks or enter any ticker symbol manually.
	‚Ä¢	Historical Data Visualization: View past trends with interactive line and bar charts for price and volume.
	‚Ä¢	Advanced Filtering and Sorting: Sort data by various parameters and apply custom filters.
	‚Ä¢	Forecasting with ML/DL Models:
	‚Ä¢	ARIMA for time-series analysis with short-term predictions.
	‚Ä¢	Prophet for daily/weekly seasonality and trend adjustments.
	‚Ä¢	LSTM for deep learning-based sequential predictions.
	‚Ä¢	Multi-Stock Comparison: Compare price and volume data for multiple stocks simultaneously.
	‚Ä¢	Export Data: Download filtered data as CSV for offline analysis.

Project Structure

The main files in this project include:
	‚Ä¢	dashboard.py: The main Streamlit dashboard code, including UI elements, data fetching, and visualization.
	‚Ä¢	ml_models.py: A separate file containing the forecasting models (ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM).
	‚Ä¢	fetch_realtime_stock_data.py: Script to fetch and update stock data.
	‚Ä¢	requirements.txt: Lists the dependencies required to run the project.
	‚Ä¢	README.md: Documentation file for project details (you‚Äôre reading this!).

Installation

Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed. Also, you‚Äôll need Streamlit, yfinance, and other dependencies listed in requirements.txt.

Steps

	1.	Clone the Repository:
 git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-data-dashboard.git
cd stock-data-dashboard

Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

	3.	Set Up the Database:
The app automatically initializes a SQLite database (stock_data.db) for storing stock data when it first runs.
	4.	Run the Dashboard:
 streamlit run dashboard.py


Usage

	1.	Load the Dashboard: Open the URL provided by Streamlit (typically http://localhost:8501).
	2.	Select a Stock: Choose from popular stocks or enter a ticker manually.
	3.	Customize Date Range: Use the sidebar date inputs to select a period from 2019 onwards.
	4.	Multi-Stock Comparison: Compare multiple stocks by selecting additional tickers.
	5.	Run Forecasting Models:
	‚Ä¢	Adjust the forecast period (days) using the slider.
	‚Ä¢	Click ‚ÄúRun Forecast‚Äù to view predictions from ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM models.
	6.	Download Data: Download the CSV file for offline analysis.

Models and Forecasting Techniques

This project implements three forecasting models:
	‚Ä¢	ARIMA: A classic time-series model suitable for stationary data with seasonality and trend components.
	‚Ä¢	Prophet: A robust forecasting tool designed by Facebook that handles missing data and seasonality well.
	‚Ä¢	LSTM: A deep learning recurrent neural network model that captures long-term dependencies in time-series data.

Each model provides prediction intervals, mean squared error (MSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) as performance metrics.

Technologies Used

	‚Ä¢	Python: Core programming language.
	‚Ä¢	Streamlit: For creating the interactive web application.
	‚Ä¢	Plotly: For interactive and responsive charting.
	‚Ä¢	pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
	‚Ä¢	yfinance: To retrieve real-time stock data.
	‚Ä¢	SQLite: For data storage.
	‚Ä¢	Machine Learning Libraries: statsmodels for ARIMA, prophet for Prophet, and tensorflow/keras for LSTM.

Future Enhancements

	‚Ä¢	Sentiment Analysis: Incorporate Twitter/Reddit sentiment analysis to enhance stock forecasts.
	‚Ä¢	More ML Models: Experiment with additional models like SARIMA, XGBoost, etc.
	‚Ä¢	Custom Watchlists: Enable users to save personalized stock watchlists.
	‚Ä¢	Enhanced Data Export: Add options for exporting data in Excel and PDF formats.
